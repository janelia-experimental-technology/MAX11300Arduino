# MAX11300
This is a library for interfacing any Arduino to the MAX11300. 

The intent is to provide access to the core functions of the MAX11300 PIXI described in the datasheet
http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX11300.pdf

As far as possible, the standard Arduino function names are used (pinMode, digitalWrite, etc).

Basic digital and anlog I/O have been implemented and tested in the initial release.

Interrupts, analog switch, and level translation functions have not yet been fully implemented or tested.

This project was forked from the MAX11300Arduino project by Pierce Nichols
